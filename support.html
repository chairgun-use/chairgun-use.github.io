  <h1>Support</h1> 

    <p>ChairGun Pro was originally developed by an optics manufacturer in the United Kingdom.
    Having abandoned it in 2018, over the course of time, it stopped working on many modern devices
    and operating systems.</p>

    <p>In an attempt to get it working on his new device, a user in the Colonies reverse-engineered
    the program. He succeeded in getting it to run on MacOS Catalina, Windows 10, and he was able
    to remove enough of the operating system specific calls to also get it to run on Linux –
    something that it was not at all designed to do. Theoretically, it may now also be very close
    to being able to be run on tablets.</p>

    <p>He contacted the Original Developer about it. They <b>very graciously</b> granted him
    permission to release his updated program as a “User Supported Edition” <b>without the source
    code</b>.</p>

    <p>This is a User&rsquo;s attempt to resurrect it.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.75em;"><b>The Original Developer does not want to be contacted about
    this software, and indeed, they have no way of supporting it, as they do not even have access
    to the updated source code for it.</b></p>

    <p>In fact, <b>in an attempt to distance themselves from the project,</b> they have asked this
    user to remove all references to their company from the program, except for their scopes and
    reticles, and have even suggested that he add scopes and reticles from other manufacturers.</p>

    <p>They have since given him permission to release it with just their scopes, and with their
    original User Manual.</p>

    <p>The best place to obtain answers to questions about how to use ChairGun is the <b>User
    Manual</b>. This can be found by selecting <b>Help &ndash;&gt; Help Topics</b> from the
    ChairGun menu. It may also be found in your <b>User/ChairGun4/Etc</b> directory.</p>

<!--

<p>As development continues, you will see more and more differences between the ChairGun USE and
the Original Developer's ChairGun Pro software. Most of these differences should be minor. Please
be flexible, and keep this in mind as you refer to the Original Developer&rsquo;s user manual. The
ChairGun USE developer will try to release an updated version of this manual as soon as
possible.</p> 

-->

    <p><b>Questions about installing it, or about any other topic not covered in the user manual
    should be emailed to the address below.</b></p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.75em;"><b>For questions or support for ChairGun USE, please
    email:</b></p>

    <p><a style="font-size: 1.75em;"
    href="mailto:chairgun.use@hotmail.com">chairgun.use@hotmail.com</a></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Final remarks:</b> Many people have asked the Original Developer for their source code,
    and they do not want to release it. And they do not want the developer of ChairGun USE to
    release his source code, either.</p>

    <p>Please do not ask the Original Developer for their source code. And please do not ask the
    developer of ChairGun USE for his source code, either. He will not release it to anybody, as
    stipulated in his agreement with them.</p>

    <p>And again, please do not contact the Original Developer about this software. They
    <b>reluctantly</b> gave the developer of ChairGun USE permission to release it. ChairGun in
    general has obviously been a big disappointment for them.</p>

    <p>It is a sore subject with them.</p>

    <p>Please leave them at peace about it.</p>
