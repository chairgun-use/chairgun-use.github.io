ChairGun Pro - User Supported Edition
-------------------------------------

ChairGun Pro was originally developed by an optics manufacturer in the United Kingdom. Having abandoned it in 2018, over the course of time, it stopped working on many modern devices and operating systems.

In an attempt to get it working on his new device, a user in the Colonies reverse-engineered the program. He succeeded in getting it to run on MacOS Catalina, Windows 10, and he was able to remove enough of the operating system specific calls to also get it to run on Linux – something that it was not at all designed to do. Theoretically, it may now also be very close to being able to be run on tablets.

He contacted the Original Developer about it. They very graciously granted him permission to release his updated program as a “User Supported Edition” without the source code.

This is a User’s attempt to resurrect it.

The Original Developer does not want to be contacted about this software, and indeed, they have no way of supporting it, as they do not even have access to the updated source code for it.

News: We are happy to announce the Initial Release ChairGun USE. If you already have the Original Developer’s edition of ChairGun running on your system, this is not likely to help you very much, other than to keep you informed of any updates to the program. It is essentially their final release, with new graphics and contact information; and it has also been extended to run on Linux as well.

We may at some point extend the program to allow the users to add their own scopes and reticles, regardless of brand, and to share the information with others; but that would be a lot of work, and it is not likely to be accomplished any time soon. If you would like to see that happen, please email the ChairGun USE developer at the above address to give him an idea of how much interest there is in that.

This is primarily intended for those who are unable to get the Original Developer’s edition of ChairGun to run on their devices.
